    <H2>A New Art Experiance</H2>
    
     <p>Hello! Now I have some more experience in HTML5! I have done some updates overall and a crappy picture in a program who was super hard to handle!
        I decided to post it here!</p><br>

     <H2>NEW EXPERIANCE WITH C#</H2>
           
        <p>Hey guys my website is starting to look better now I got my colors out and aslo some fixes in CSS that makes the site special!
           Parallel with my Web technical introduction class I have an other class called Introductory Programming with C#! 
           I just now finished my first laborations and the all got approved!
           I had some real strugels at the begining of the class because i have never programed anything before...
           I'm lucky to have awsome friends wich I can work with and lern from. If someone have any struggle with something
           there is always somebody there to help to salve the problem!
           Now when we are done with the first three laborations we're starting the next step wich I hope will be a pice of cake!</p>
