                <p>Hey guys my website is starting to look better now I got my colors out and aslo some fixes in CSS that makes the site special!
                Parallel with my Web technical introduction class I have an other class called Introductory Programming with C#! 
                I just now finished my first laborations and the all got approved!
                I had some real strugels at the begining of the class because i have never programed anything before...
                I'm lucky to have awsome friends wich I can work with and lern from. If someone have any struggle with something
                there is always somebody there to help to salve the problem!
                Now when we are done with the first three laborations we're starting the next step wich I hope will be a pice of cake!
                Tonight me and my friends is going to celebrate that we made it the far! And now I'm only writing because i dont want to make
                the picture in this text any smaler and it have to be text around it just to prove that i can handle CSS comands in the right way.</p>
            
            
                <H2>Ctrl-C - Ctrl-V... How hard can it be?</H2>
                
                <p> This week I have been working with a project called copycat. I is exactly what is sounds like, you are going to copy or better called redo a website
                    our teacher have done. It was not too hard but some steps really made me hate CSS. There is a link to the website I recreated at my laborations pages
                    go check it out!</p>
