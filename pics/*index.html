         <H1> Anton Larsson! <H1>
            
        <br> Hey, my name is Anton Larsson. I'm 20 years old and have just moved to kalmar with my patner.
        <br> For 20 years I have lived in kristianstad with my family wish i will talk about later.
        <br> I'm here in kalmar to studdy and I'll be studding Developer of Digital Services for 3 years.
        <br> Furthermore in this text i will be talking alitle more about myself, off my interests, family,
        <br> my past and my future.
            
            
            
            <p>My Intrests</p>
        <br> Today I dont have so many interests. like I mentioned earlier I just moved here to kalmar and I am still settling down.
        <br> Before I moved here I was training alot, and i was training karate.
        <br> I've traind karate for around 14 years now and when i moved to kalmar i had to quit my training
        <br> but only for a small time. Now whe I'm done moving in and feel like I got controll of my studding
        <br> I'm goning to start train agin. I know there is a karate club in kalmar and I've talked to my sensei
        <br> back in kristianstad and he was going to talk to the club and say that i might start training there,
        <br> but I would still keep my own club mark.
        <br> Otherwise I'm just like everybody else. I like to spend time with friends and also with my partner.
        
        
            <p> My Family</p>
        <br> I got a pretty small family so its not much to say about it. It's me my mom and dad and my sister.
        <br> now both me and my sister have moved out so mom and dad is left alone in our hose in kristianstad.
        <br> My sister did not move so far she moved into the center of kristianstad. she work at a grocery store
        <br> and her appartment is walking distans from the store.
        <br> My dad is a teatcher in music he have been a teatcher for a really long time now.
        <br> Even i had him in school and of course i got the highest grade.
        <br> My mom she works on a company called Malmberg she have worked there for around 5 years i think.
        <br> I think she really like this job its much to organize and its really close to home so she can take the bike
        <br> every day.
        
            <p>What i am good/bad at</p>
        <br> Always when this question appear I can't figure anything out about myself. What am I good at?
        <br> Well i guess I'm good at karate, I got a black belt and I won the Swedish championship 2009
        <br> and to me that pretty good. Otherwise I'm good at sports och computers.
        <br> The we have come to what I am bad at. I would say that I'm bad at consentrating, when I sit still
        <br> or do something for a long time I can get restless and my consentration gets really poor.
        
            <P>Earlier education</P>
        <br> Before I moved to kalmar I studdied social sciences for 3 years at Soderportgymnasiet in kristianstad.
        <br> It was a really good school, good teatchers and an awsome class to studdy with.
        
            <p>Workexperiances</p>
        I have had a couple of jobs in my life, some a bit better that the others. When I was 15 I got my first job.
        The jobb was in the city so it was easy to take the buss there. It was a job as a cleaner in a stairhouse.
        Every thursday I want in to town to clean the coridors and stairs, and it only took me about 1h and i got
        300kr every time i did it. And no it was not a black job i got all the money at end of month and they even took tax.
        This job i did untill i moved to kalmar so for 5 years and a bit more. My second and third job I got when I was 16.
        One of them was only a summer job, but who became a jobb for four summers in a row. The other job was a weekend job 
        and also some days when i had a day off in school. The job who i had in the sommers was as a garbage man and the
        other was in a hot dog stand. Both where really good jobs! And now finnaly I have come to my last job I had before the move
        and that was at Ica Maxi in Kristianstad. I only worked there for a summer bot hopfully i get to work there next summer too
        and maybe now at the winter hollydays.
        
            <p>Have I programd earlier?</p>
        This is a really easy awnser, no i have not.
        
            <p>What got me to apply to this education?</p>
        I always wanted to studdie about computers and a computereducation is really where i belong.
        When I serched for education I found manny IT-educations, but also this education
        Developer of Digital Services and i derectly applyed for it! And now after 2 weeks of studding
        I'm already sure I'm gunna belong in this class!
        
            <p>My thoughts about the future</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finnish my education.</li>
            <li>Do something extrodenary</li>        
                <ol>
                    <li>Travle</li>
                    <li>Do crazy stuff</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Find a job</li>
            <li>Settledown</li>
        </ul>
        
        
            <p>Finnish my education</p>
        First off all in my future I'm going to finnish my education i have started and wile I'm doing my studding I hopefully
        find some advanture coming my way.
        
            <p>Do something extrodenary</p>
        My two subpoints is kind of together. The both are extrodenary in its own way and maybe I'll find them together somewhere. 
        1. Travle: With travle I mean to places you have to have seen. Like grand cannion, China, Usa and so on.
        2. Do crazy stuff: With this I mean like doing a bungy jump, jump with a parachute and other stuff like this.
        
        
            <p>Find a job</p>
        After all off this fun stuff I wanna do in the future is gonna cost money so when i get back home I'm going to need a job.
        hopfully I will find a job who is about programing but wile I'm trying to find that I would not say no to just be on Maxi working.
        
        
            <p>Settledown</p>
        When i found a good job there i feel happy I will get an apartment or a house there around hopfully with my partner i got now.
