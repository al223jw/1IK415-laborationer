            <H1> Anton Larsson! <H1>
            
        <br> Hey, my name is Anton Larsson. I'm 20 years old and have just moved to kalmar with my patner.
        <br> For 20 years I have lived in kristianstad with my family wish i will talk about later.
        <br> I'm here in kalmar to studdy and I'll be studding Developer of Digital Services for 3 years.
        <br> Furthermore in this text i will be talking alitle more about myself, off my interests, family,
        <br> my past and my future.
            
            
            
            <p>My Intrests</p>
        <br> Today I dont have so many interests. like I mentioned earlier I just moved here to kalmar and I am still settling down.
        <br> Before I moved here I was training alot, and i was training karate.
        <br> I've traind karate for around 14 years now and when i moved to kalmar i had to quit my training
        <br> but only for a small time. Now whe I'm done moving in and feel like I got controll of my studding
        <br> I'm goning to start train agin. I know there is a karate club in kalmar and I've talked to my sensei
        <br> back in kristianstad and he was going to talk to the club and say that i might start training there,
        <br> but I would still keep my own club mark.
        <br> Otherwise I'm just like everybody else. I like to spend time with friends and also with my partner.
        
        
            <p>Familj</p>
        <br> I got a pretty small family so its not much to say about it. It's me my mom and dad and my sister.
        <br> now both me and my sister have moved out so mom and dad is left alone in our hose in kristianstad.
        <br> My sister did not move so far she moved into the center of kristianstad. she work at a grocery store
        <br> and her appartment is walking distans from the store.
        <br> My dad is a teatcher in music he have been a teatcher for a really long time now.
        <br> Even i had him in school and of course i got the highest grade.
        <br> My mom she works on a company called Malmberg she have worked there for around 5 years i think.
        <br> I think she really like this job its much to organize and its really close to home so she can take the bike
        <br> every day.
